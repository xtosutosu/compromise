# Minecraft Compromise

If you’ve been playing Minecraft for a while, then you know that the 1.14 update brought with it an array of textures changes out of which most were welcome but a sizeable portion of the fanbase started to miss more classic looking Minecraft worlds.
Many of those people started to create or use resource packs with the aim to adapt developer art into newer Minecraft, as Mojang decided not to do so.

Minecraft Compromise in that matter is different. Why? I want to provide players with the best of both worlds as it consists of the worthwhile changes made in Village and Pillage update but blends all the other changes that didn’t particularly fit well with the game’s overall style.

Another change is that Minecraft Compromise brings back an array of old sounds or blends them with newer ones, while also providing a few user-interface tweaks that make it look a lot sleeker and more appealing. I have decided to also use some tweaks provided by Vanilla Tweaks team. There's no point in not doing so.
